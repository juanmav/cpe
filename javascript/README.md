# Collaborative Programming Exercise

The validation environment for your parser is written in _mocha_ and _chai_
and runs on the latest LTS release of Node.js.

You can start the project by running
```
grunt test
```

Which will run all *phase 1* tests against the skeleton parser; *parser.js*.

Once you have completed phase 1, you can enable the next phase by removing the _.skip_ in index.js.
